## Subsystems

Work in TJ CUBESAT is split into subsystems, or teams, each subsystem specializing in one aspect of the CubeSat.

### Programming

The programming subsystem is responsible for the development, maintaining, and testing of the software that controls the CubeSat in flight. From time to time, electronics team members will develop code specific to a piece of hardware or device, it is the responsibility of the programming team to see that such code is properly integrated with the current flight software.
